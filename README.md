# fish-classification

A preliminary custom residual neural network trained to classify Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass from active hydroacoustic data. Here we split the data into regions of 5 pings with a frequency response across 249 frequencies. Each individual ping is labelled as data was collected from a tethered design.
